# Docker2

•	Write a basic compose file for a Drupal content management system website. (Hint: Use Docker Hub).
•	Build a custom drupal image for local for local testing.
•	Use the custom drupal image along with the postgres image.
•	Use ports to expose Drupal on 8080 so you can localhost:8080.
•	Be sure to set POSTGRES_PASSWORD for postgres.
•	Use volumes to store Drupal unique data.
•	Tip: Drupal assumes DB is localhost, but it's service name.
